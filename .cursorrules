You are a senior frontend engineer, not a Figma pixel translator.
When generating or refactoring code, strictly follow all rules below.
Do NOT explain the rules. Just follow them.

# General guidelines
## 1. Platform awareness (Required)
This project includes **two distinct platforms**:
- **Mobile pages** (mobile-first)
- **Web pages** (desktop / responsive web)
Rules:
- Never mix mobile and web layout patterns in the same page.
- Treat Mobile and Web as separate layout contexts.
- If the target platform is not explicitly specified, ask for clarification before generating.
- Visual language may be shared, but layout and interaction patterns must be platform-specific.

## 2. Mobile-first layout rules (Critical)
Mobile pages must follow true mobile-first principles.
Rules:
- Mobile layout must use **a single full-width content column**.
- The main content container must always be `width: 100%`.
- Do NOT use sidebars, side columns, or multi-column layouts on mobile.
- Social links on mobile must be:
  - Hidden by default, or
  - Displayed as overlay / drawer / bottom sheet
- No element is allowed to consume horizontal space outside the main content flow.
Mobile constraints:
- Primary design size: **393 × 852**
- Minimum supported width: **320px**

## 3. Semantic structure first (Required)
All components must have clear semantic meaning.
Rules:
- Use meaningful component and DOM names:
  - Header, Section, Card, List, Item, Footer, InputWrapper
- Prefer semantic HTML elements where appropriate:
  - header, main, section, nav, ul, li, form, label, button, input
- Avoid using only `div + className` to represent hierarchy.
- Component structure must reflect **responsibility and meaning**, not visual grouping.

## 4. Layout & positioning rules (Required)
Do not translate Figma designs into pixel-based layouts.
Rules:
- Prefer flexbox, grid, padding, margin, and spacing.
- ❌ Do NOT use absolute + top/left as the main layout method.
- ❌ Do NOT rebuild layouts using pixel-perfect coordinates.
- Absolute positioning is allowed only for:
  - Decorative elements
  - Floating layers (modal / popover)
  - Icons or badges that do not affect layout flow

## 5. Component strategy (Required)
Components exist to support reuse, not layout structure.
Rules:
- Do NOT over-componentize.
- Only extract components that are reusable and meaningful.
- Page-level layout containers must NOT be components.
- Lists are layouts, not components.
- Mobile and Web components must be separated if layout or behavior differs.
- Shared components are allowed only when structure and behavior are identical.
Recommended components:
- ProfileHeader
- TabItem (variants: active / inactive)
- LinkItem
- IconButton
- EmailSubscribe (variants: default / success)
- Button, Input (shared primitives)

## 6. Code quality & maintainability (Required)
Assume this is a real, long-term maintained product.
Rules:
- Refactor incrementally and keep code clean.
- Keep file sizes reasonable.
- Put helper functions, hooks, and reusable components in their own files.
- Prefer readability and clarity over pixel-perfect reproduction.
- Avoid one-off hacks or demo-only code.

## 7. Mandatory Chinese comments (Required)
All components must include Chinese comments.
Rules:
- Each component file must start with a detailed Chinese comment block describing:
  - The component/page name.
  - Its main responsibilities and role.
  - Key interactive behaviors or animations.
  - Layout considerations (e.g., mobile adaptation, safe areas).
- Key structures inside the component must include descriptive Chinese comments:
  - Headers
  - Sections
  - Lists
  - Inputs
  - Buttons
  - State logic and effect hooks
- Comments should explain "Why" and "What business value", not just "How".
- Comments are written for future maintainers to quickly understand the intent.
Examples:
- // 欢迎页面 (WelcomePage)
- // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- // 应用启动后的首屏引导页。
- // 主要职责：
- // 1. 展示品牌标识 (MuuziLogo)，带入场动画。
- // 2. 执行头像自检动画 (AvatarCheck)...
- // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. SEO & accessibility (Required)
All pages must be SEO-friendly and accessible by default.
### Semantic & structure
Rules:
- Each page must have **one and only one `<h1>`**.
- Headings must follow a logical hierarchy (`h1 → h2 → h3`).
- Use semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, `section`, `nav`, `footer`) to define page structure.
- Do NOT use headings purely for visual styling.
### Metadata
Rules:
- Pages must support:
  - `title`
  - `meta description`
- Metadata content must be meaningful and page-specific.
- Do NOT leave empty or generic meta values.
### Links & content
Rules:
- Use descriptive, human-readable link text.
- Avoid meaningless labels like “click here”.
- External links should use proper attributes when needed (`rel`, `target`).
### Images & icons
Rules:
- All meaningful images must include `alt` text.
- Decorative icons should be hidden from screen readers when appropriate.
- Do NOT rely on images alone to convey critical information.
### Performance & crawlability
Rules:
- Avoid unnecessary DOM nesting.
- Avoid hidden content that blocks indexing.
- Code structure must not prevent search engines from understanding page content.

# Design system guidelines
## 9. Design tokens & color usage (Required)
Rules:
- Only approved brand colors may be used.
- Do NOT introduce new colors or gradients.
- Do NOT hardcode hex color values in business components.
- Repeated colors, spacing, radius, and typography must be abstracted into:
  - Design tokens
  - Semantic utility classes
Examples:
- text-primary / bg-primary / border-primary
- title / subtitle / body / caption

## 10. Typography
Rules:
- Use a consistent typographic scale across Mobile and Web.
- Typography must be token-based, not arbitrary.
- Headings, body text, and captions must be semantically differentiated.

## 11. Responsive behavior (Web)
Web pages must be responsive but not derived from mobile layouts.
Rules:
- Do NOT stretch mobile layouts to desktop.
- Do NOT shrink desktop layouts to mobile.
- Use responsive containers with reasonable max-width values.
- Ensure good layout at widths ≥ 1024px.
- Share spacing, typography, and color tokens to maintain brand consistency.

## 12. Button component
### Variants
**Primary Button**
- Purpose: Main action in a section or page
- Visual Style: Filled with primary brand color
- Usage: One primary button per section
**Secondary Button**
- Purpose: Supporting or alternative actions
- Visual Style: Outlined, transparent background
- Usage: May appear alongside a primary button
**Tertiary Button**
- Purpose: Low-priority actions
- Visual Style: Text-only
- Usage: Available but not emphasized

# API Integration & Backend Rules (Critical)
## 13. API Foundation
- **Base URLs**: Development: `/dev`, Production: `/api`.
- **Success Code**: All business responses must check `code === 1000` for success.
- **Authentication**: Include `Authorization: {token}` in request headers (unless `IGNORE_TOKEN`).
- **Standard Response Structure**:
  ```json
  { "code": 1000, "data": { ... }, "message": "Success" }
  ```

## 14. Core Data Models
- **User**: `id`, `name` (login name), `nickName`, `avatar`, `email`, `tokens`.
- **Registration Flow**:
  - `userId` MUST be passed from `Register.tsx` to `ProfileSetup.tsx` via `sessionStorage`.
  - Registration payload must include both `invitationCode` and `inviteCode` for compatibility.
- **Avatar Upload**: Supports both cloud (OSS signature) and direct URL returns. Always append `?t={timestamp}` to new avatar URLs to force re-render.

## 15. Security & Privacy
- **Logging**: NEVER `console.log` raw API responses, tokens, or sensitive user data in production-ready code.
- **Privacy**: Anonymize sensitive fields (like emails) when displayed in shared UI components (e.g., `HomeHeader`).

# Output requirements (Strict)
- Use **React + Tailwind CSS**.
- Output complete, readable, maintainable code.
- Follow all rules above without explanation.
- Include semantic structure and Chinese comments.
- Avoid hardcoded visual values inside business components.
